                    Our annual flagship event, The Ground Station Workshop is majorly aimed at educating engineering college
                    students and enthusiasts about ground stations so they could set up ground stations or initiate space
                    and ham-related projects.
                    <br>
                    Every year students from every corner of the country come to attend this 1-day long free-of-cost
                    technical workshop. Attendees are taught some of the basic parameters and equipment required to build a
                    basic ground station by several team members from the Student Satellite Program, IIT Bombay. They are
                    also informed of some non-technical aspects such as the intricacies of building and maintaining a team,
                    cost analysis.
                    <br>
                    Mr. Sanjay Nekkanti, CEO of Dhruva Space was invited as a guest speaker for GSW â€˜21 which was held in
                    online mode. He shared his insights on the future of space entrepreneurship and ground station building 
                    while concluding with a QnA session.
                    <br>
                    The workshop is open to all engineering students and faculty, although non-engineering students can
                    also attend.
