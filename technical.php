As part of our ground station activities, we have tracked the FOX-1D satellite using a foldable Yagi-Uda antenna and also received SSTV images from the International Space Station using a hand-held transceiver (Baofeng UV-5R) in January 2020.

                        Due to the coronavirus pandemic and lack of access to our ground station and equipment, we decided to widen our scope and explore virtual tracking with the help of webSDRs. It is done by accessing ground stations across the world to receive signals.

The members of the Student Satellite Program are regularly trained and made to compete online to track satellites and receive signals.

NOAA is a US-based agency that deploys a series of weather satellites in space and sends images of the Earth. We successfully tracked NOAA 15,18 and 19 to receive images of the Earth above Europe and America.

                    Amateur Radio on the International Space Station (ARISS) is a program to connect students and amateur radio enthusiasts from around the world to the astronauts at ISS. In this program, astronauts transmit some signals for amateur radio enthusiasts to receive them. These signals are usually encoded images transmitted using the SSTV communication protocol. Inter-MAI-75 (Formation and Popularization of Space Exploration) is an experiment by the Moscow Aviation Institute under the ARISS program. Here are some of the images successfully received and decoded by our team members

                    On the 20th anniversary of the ARISS program, ISS transmitted SSTV images from 24th December to 31st December 2020. We participated in this activity and successfully received the SSTV images. Ham Radio Club, IIT Bombay was honoured to have been awarded the ‘ARISS SSTV Award’ for the same.

                    Slow Scan Television is a picture transmission method used mainly by ham radio operators. Static pictures are transmitted and received via analog frequency modulation in HF, UHF and VHF bands. Every pixel in an image is represented as a sinusoid of different frequencies and color is achieved by encoding the brightness of each color component separately. Demodulation can generate an audio representation of the image.

                        Meteor detection is a hobby like ham radio. It comes under the umbrella of amateur radio astronomy. Meteor detection plays a vital role in some of the studies related to space exploration. The people involved in the meteor visualization and detection process are called meteor hunters.
We started to get involved in the process of meteor detection in 2020, continuously detecting meteors over Europe since September. The number of meteor detections depends on the occurrence of meteor showers and sources of meteors in outer space and their approach to earth and many other factors. During a meteor shower event, the number of meteor detections per hour becomes very high.
The Geminids are a prolific meteor shower caused by the object 3200 Phaethon, which is thought to be a Palladian asteroid with a "rock comet" orbit. It occurred from the 4th of December to the 17th of December, with a peak on the 14th of December. In December 2020, we confirmed the occurrence of Geminids meteor shower by receiving a significantly higher number of meteor detections than usual.
We only used a laptop with a good internet connection for the detections mentioned above. We used CAMRAS webSDR, which provides signals received by the Dwingeloo Radio Telescope. For post-processing, the signal spectrum lab software was used. We detected around 209 meteors/hour during the meteor shower, whereas in normal conditions, an average of 50-100 meteor detections/hour is expected. 
Anyone can be involved in this process. You just need a laptop and an internet connection.
